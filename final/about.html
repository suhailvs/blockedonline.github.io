<div class="grey-title">PRIVACY STATEMENT</div>
<div class="sub-title m-top">

  <p>Effective date: August 25, 2014</p>
  
  <p>The BlockedOnline project (&ldquo;BlockedOnline&rdquo;) is committed to respecting and protecting your personal privacy. This Privacy Statement explains how BlockedOnline collects, uses and shares your information. It applies to the blockedonline.com and blockedonline.net websites (the &ldquo;Websites&rdquo;), the desktop client (the &ldquo;Client&rdquo;), the browser add-on (the &ldquo;Add-on&rdquo;), and any other functionality or services associated with, or offered by BlockedOnline (collectively, the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;). 
  </p>
  <p>Please review this Privacy Statement carefully before using any of the Services. Your use of the Services indicates your agreement with the terms of this Privacy Statement. 
  </p>
  <h2>Collection of Information</h2>
  <h3>By the Websites</h3>
  <p>When you visit the Websites, the following information may be collected by BlockedOnline:
  </p>
  <ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-chevron-right"></i>the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using,</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-chevron-right"></i>the version of the web browser you are using,</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-chevron-right"></i>the operating system running on the computer you are using, and</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-chevron-right"></i>information about your navigation through pages of the Websites.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>BlockedOnline may collect site navigation information by using session cookies, which are temporary files stored on your browser. BlockedOnline uses these cookies to help the Websites work properly and to improve the user experience. BlockedOnline may also use persistent cookies to store certain information about you across different browsing sessions. You can block or delete cookies using standard web browser controls. 
  </p>
  <p>Please note that while it is our standard policy not to use IP address logs to track the sessions of individual users, there are some important exceptions. These exceptions include cases of reported violations of our Terms of Service, and in cases where we are required to do so by law enforcement (see &ldquo;<a href="#">Disclosure of Information to Law Enforcement</a>&rdquo; below).
  </p>
  
  <h3>By the Client or Add-on</h3>
  <p>When you download, install and run the Client or Add-on, each will ask you to submit your country name and, optionally, your email address. Then,&nbsp;automatically and in the background, the Client or Add-on will load a list of websites from our server (&ldquo;Target Sites&rdquo;) and attempt to access each Target Site on your behalf. &nbsp;The Client or Add-on then gathers and transmits the following information for each Target Site to our servers:
  </p>
  <ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-chevron-right"></i>the Target Site URL,</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-chevron-right"></i>history of redirections when attempting to access the Target Site,</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-chevron-right"></i>the http status of the Target Site request,</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-chevron-right"></i>the time it takes for the Target Site to load,</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-chevron-right"></i>your IP address,</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-chevron-right"></i>Target Site content, as viewed on your computer, and</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-chevron-right"></i>the cookies and headers of the Target Site.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Target Sites are independent, third-party websites which may collect information from your computer, such as your IP address. Any information collected by the Target Sites is governed by their policies and terms. BlockedOnline is not responsible for the information practices of the Target Sites.
  </p>
  <p>If you have an existing relationship with a Target Site, we may inadvertently receive personal session data&nbsp;as part of the request to that site. This data will only be used to determine internet censorship, and we will not otherwise attempt to extract or utilize it. Except as described above, the Client and Add-on do NOT track your personal activities on your computer or browser.
  </p>
  

  <h2>Use and Sharing of Information</h2>
  <h3>Use of Information</h3>
  <p>If you gave us your email address, we will use it to communicate with you only about BlockedOnline (i.e., to resolve support issues, send you updates, or notify you of changes to our policies). &nbsp;Your email address will not be used for other purposes, and will not be shared with any other website.
  </p>
  <p>We use the information collected through blockedonline.com and blockedonline.net to ensure that the sites work properly, and to improve the user experience. 
  </p>
  <p>We use the information collected through the Client and the Add-on to make non-identifying, aggregate statistics&nbsp;publicly available on the Websites, or our partners&rsquo; platforms in accordance with our policies. (See &ldquo;<a href="#">Sharing Information with Third Parties</a>&rdquo;).
  </p>
  <p>All of the information stored on our servers may be accessed by our system administrators. Some information is stored with the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and may be accessible to their administrators in accordance with their information practices and policies.
  </p>

  <h3>Sharing Information with Third Parties</h3>
  <p>BlockedOnline may share information with third-party service providers who assist us in delivering the Services to users. For example, we currently use Amazon Web Services for server hosting and data storage services.&nbsp;These third-party providers are not authorized by BlockedOnline to use your information for purposes other than as described in this policy. &nbsp;We do not share your personal information with third parties for their own marketing or advertising purposes. 
  </p>
  <p>BlockedOnline may also share non-identifying, aggregate data with partners or affiliates&nbsp;in support of their reporting and research efforts. 
  </p>
  <p>BlockedOnline enables you to share certain information via third party sites or services, such as Facebook and Twitter. Please note that these third parties may collect certain data about your computer, including your IP address, and that any information collected by or shared through these types of third-party websites and services will be used and shared by those sites and services according to their privacy policies and settings. BlockedOnline is not responsible for the privacy practices or content on third-party websites and services.
  </p>
  <p>We may also transfer your information, including your email address, to our successors as part of a sale, merger or restructuring&nbsp;of BlockedOnline. In this case, BlockedOnline will make reasonable efforts to (i) notify users of the transfer via our Websites or by email and (ii) ensure that our successor handles your personal information in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Statement. 
  </p>  
  <h3>Disclosure of Information to Law Enforcement</h3>
  <p>If we receive a warrant or subpoena for user information, or are otherwise legally compelled to provide such information, we may disclose requested records to law enforcement authorities or outside parties seeking information through the legal process. In the event that we are required by law (including by a court order) to disclose the information that is related to you, and we have your email address, we will attempt to provide you with notice (unless we are prohibited from doing so) that a request for your information has been made so that you may object to the disclosure. We make no guarantee that we will be able to object on your behalf. If you do not challenge the disclosure request yourself, we may be legally required to turn over your information.
